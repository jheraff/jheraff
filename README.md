Hi, I'm Jhermayne 👋
Originally a self-taught programmer, now pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science all while making fun and interesting projects in my spare time. I love working in Python and am adaptable to working with a range of other languages and frameworks. Updated almost daily, I put pretty much all of my projects here.

📚 I'm a current senior at California State University, Northridge
👀 I’m interested in full-stack development with a focus on the back-end, but I like exploring other topics on the side!
🌱 I'm currently:
Searching for a Summer 2024 SWE internship based in the US
Doing web design work for my university's department webpages
Developing for the iOS on the smart clothing app for ARCS
Working on a couple side projects, including my roguelike and a social cookbook app
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun, open-source projects
