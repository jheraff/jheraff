Hi, I'm Jhermayne 👋
While growing up, I have been interested in how the way websites and games are made and this has made it where I have pursed a bachelor's degree in Computer Science all while making projects that I have been interested on for the past couple of years. I am great in working with Java, Python, and C# but I do love learning languages in general so I am adaptable to working with a range of other languages and frameworks. 

+ 📚 I'm a California State University, Northridge graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
+ 👀 I’m interested in creating games, websites, and learning new things
+ 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun, open-source projects
